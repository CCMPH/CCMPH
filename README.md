### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Celeke. 

I am studying software engineering at Codam Coding College.
When I started at Codam in 2021, I didn't know anything about coding. Now I'm learning new things everyday!
On my Github page you can find the projects I created. Hope you enjoy following my journey on this git.
